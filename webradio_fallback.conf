# This is the only configuration-File for the Python-Script "webradio.py". All Values entered here will be read only
# at each startup of the script and can not be changed and respected during runtime.
# Please note, that you need "sudo" in your start-command, when you want to use the GPIOs (In and Out)
# -> sudo python /home/pi/webradio/webradio.py
# Also please note the different Starting - Methodes:
#(1)    python ~/webradio/webradio.py                              >> Real GPIOs inactiv, WITH Simulator
#(2)    python ~/webradio/webradio.py  --disable-gpio              >> Real GPIOs inactiv, NO Simulator
#(3)    sudo python ~/webradio/webradio.py                         >> Real GPIOs activ, NO Simulator
#
# Also keep in Mind the different Startup-Arguments which you may add:
#'--no-network-check'   ='Ignore missing network connection')
#'--debug'              ='Show debug messages')
#'--disable-gpio'       ='Disables GPIOs (Only available on Raspberry Pi)')
#'--fullscreen'         ='Shows Window in Full-Screen Mode')
#'--touchscreen'        ='disables visible mouse-pointer')

# Screen Resolution : Define the Resolution of the Display which is used. This will affect the Window-Size.
# Possible Values: 1024x600   800x480    700x480   640x480 -> 1024x600 will be used as fallback and is recommended

# (in mpd.conf it is called 'music_directory')

# "VARIABLE_DATABASE_NAME" : Give the NAME (not the path) of the symbolic link, which you may have placed into your
# Music-Folder. In your "variable Database" a exchangeable data-storage like an USB-Stick should get mounted.
# Note that this subfolder or symbolic link gets updated as soon as something is mounted in the mountpoint.

# Weather_LocationID : This is the Location-ID for your specific town. The weatherforecast will be shown for this
#In order do find the correct Location-ID, I suggest to visit "https://weather.com/de-DE" and search for your town
#in the upper right corner.
#With a search for "Hamburg" you will be forwarded to the Browser-Adress:

# False = Spinner
# True = SpinBox

# In the subfolder "res/designs" are different designs to choose. The design which is currently active can be changed

# Power_switch: Note: The Power-Switch has a double Function, first is "Longpress" which turns the radio OFF, second is
# short-click to "umount" a mounted USB-Stick...
# DO NOT USE OTHER PIN FOR ON/OFF BUTTON! Otherwise you will not be able to start the pi from halt (standby)
